## Our Goal

In this app I tried to improve my skills and developed an app with API features. 
Main idea of this app is pretty simple - grab real live data from the Internet with respect to the weather for requested city.
This app is able to check the weather for the current location based on the GPS data from the iPhone as well as by searching for a city manually. 

## I learned how to

* Create a dark-mode enabled app.
* Use vector images as image assets.
* Use the UITextField to get user input. 
* Use delegate pattern.
* Swift protocols and extensions works. 
* Swift guard keyword works. 
* Swift computed properties works.
* Use URLSession to network and make HTTP requests.
* Parse JSON with the native Encodable and Decodable protocols. 
* Use Grand Central Dispatch to fetch the main thread.
* Use Core Location to get the current location from the phone GPS.
